# Contributing to Elements of Agentic System Design

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to demystify agentic AI systems through clear conceptual frameworks.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues
- Found an error or inaccuracy? Open an issue.
- Something unclear or confusing? Let us know.
- Missing an important concept? Suggest additions.

### Improve Content
- Better examples that illustrate concepts
- Clearer explanations of complex ideas
- Real-world case studies
- Corrections to technical details

### Add Examples
- Code examples that demonstrate patterns
- Case studies of real agentic systems analyzed through the framework
- Before/after comparisons showing the framework in action

### Translations
- Help make this framework accessible in other languages
- Open an issue to coordinate translation efforts

## Contribution Process

1. **Open an issue first** — For non-trivial changes, discuss your idea before starting work
2. **Fork the repository**
3. **Make your changes** — Follow the existing style and structure
4. **Submit a pull request** — Reference the related issue

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Clear, direct prose — avoid jargon where possible
- Concrete over abstract — use specific examples
- Demystifying tone — map "intelligent" behaviors to simple code patterns
- No unnecessary complexity — the goal is clarity

### Structure
Each element follows this structure:
- **Introduction**: What it is, why it's foundational, what it looks like
- **Demystification**: Behavior → Code patterns table, core mechanism
- **Design Considerations**: Key questions, tradeoffs, patterns
- **The Reframe**: Before/after mental model shifts

### Formatting
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown
- Code blocks with language hints
- Tables for behavior → implementation mappings
- Consistent header hierarchy

## Co-Authorship Opportunities

This outline will be expanded into a comprehensive book on agentic system design. If you're interested in co-authoring or making substantial contributions:

**Contact**: william@idylliclabs.com

Please include:
- Your background and expertise in AI/ML systems
- Which elements you're most interested in contributing to
- Any relevant writing samples or prior work

Substantial contributors will be credited as co-authors in the published book.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the work, not the person
- Assume good intent
